            <p>
                Hello! I'm Mia, a chinese girl with a deep passion for interactive media and creative design. 
                I'm an INFP, which reflects my love for creativity, introspection, and meaningful connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), where I double-majored in Computer Science and Computer Science: Game Design. 
                This unique combination fueled my love for creating engaging and immersive experiences, especially through games. 
                Many of my projects revolve around puzzle games and RPGs, reflecting my dedication to crafting intricate narratives and fun gameplay mechanics. 
                My favorite games include <em><strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Rusty Lake</strong></em> series, which inspire me with their storytelling and creative worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond coding and gaming, I have a wide array of hobbies. I love traveling and exploring new cultures, building Gundam models, 
                and immersing myself in experiences that spark joy and creativity.
